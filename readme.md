Phase 1: Backend - Data Handling (Conversations 1-5)
Question 1: "How do I load and display the sensor data from the CSV file using Python?"

Goal: Load data from data.csv and display a summary (e.g., first 5 rows).
Question 2: "How do I write a function to save processed data back to the CSV file?"

Goal: Save filtered or updated data back to data.csv.
Question 3: "How do I add a function to validate the sensor data?"

Goal: Ensure all rows in data.csv have valid fields (e.g., no missing or invalid values).
Question 4: "How can I filter the sensor data by type or location?"

Goal: Write functions to extract data based on sensor_type or location.
Question 5: "How do I append new sensor readings to the CSV file?"

Goal: Add a new sensor reading programmatically to data.csv.
Phase 2: Backend - Data Processing (Conversations 6-10)
Question 6: "How do I calculate basic statistics for sensor readings?"

Goal: Compute the mean, max, and min values for each sensor_type.
Question 7: "How do I detect anomalies in sensor data?"

Goal: Define thresholds for anomalies (e.g., strain > 50) and identify them in the data.
Question 8: "How can I group and summarize data by time intervals?"

Goal: Group sensor readings by hours or days and calculate summary statistics.
Question 9: "How do I generate summaries by location or sensor type?"

Goal: Summarize the total number of readings and averages by location or sensor_type.
Question 10: "How do I export processed data to a new CSV file?"

Goal: Save processed data (e.g., anomalies or summaries) to a separate CSV file.
Phase 3: Frontend - Visualization (Conversations 11-15)
Question 11: "How do I create a line graph of sensor readings over time using Matplotlib?"

Goal: Plot a graph for a specific sensor_id to show readings over time.
Question 12: "How do I compare average sensor readings by type or location in a bar chart?"

Goal: Create bar charts comparing averages for sensor_type or location.
Question 13: "How do I highlight anomalies on the graph?"

Goal: Mark anomalies on the graph with a different color or symbol.
Question 14: "How do I save generated graphs as images?"

Goal: Save Matplotlib plots as .png or .jpg files in the reports/visualizations folder.
Question 15: "How do I display summaries and graphs in an HTML file?"

Goal: Use index.html to display graphs and key summaries in a simple webpage.
Phase 4: Advanced Features (Conversations 16-20)
Question 16: "How do I simulate new sensor data and update the CSV file dynamically?"

Goal: Write a script to simulate and add new data to data.csv.
Question 17: "How do I create a command-line menu for filtering, summarizing, and visualizing data?"

Goal: Build a CLI to allow users to interact with the project.
Question 18: "How can I automate anomaly notifications in real-time?"

Goal: Print warnings in the terminal whenever anomalies are detected.
Question 19: "How do I refactor the code for better organization?"

Goal: Separate logic into reusable Python modules for clarity.
Question 20: "How do I document and test the project?"

Goal: Write a simple README and perform a final test of all features.
